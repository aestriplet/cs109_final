This Zodiac program (Zodiac_signs.py) deciphers a users zodiac sign based on their input. It uses various topics or concepts that were covered in class for an example it uses various datatypes (mainly strings and floats), user input, conditional statements, functions, and datas tructures.
The program starts by creating a class called me that uses input to decipher a persons zodiac sign. The function id defined as sign while user input and if else statements based on month and day determine weather a person is either one sign or the other. 


While the second program (graph.py) uses data structures and external libraries to create visualizations. The external libraries used in the program are matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. To create the program I decided to use stats on Zodiac Signs. For an example, I used a website called Statician Brain to se the population percentage of Zodiac signs. I tried to scrap the data using scrapy, but I found it difficult to use at times and I wasn't sure whether the websites terms allowed data scraping/text mining. As a result, I entered the data manually using lists. The x asxis consists of the various Zodiac signs while the y axis uses the population percentages. Using a barplot to visualize the data. Lasly, I imported the other modules/file called Zodiac.py. 

The third program (graph2.py) uses data structures and external libraries to create visualizations. The external libraries used in the program are matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. This program also uses Zodiac signs data to plot the difference between men and women who check their horscope. 

The fourth program (Zodiac2) uses user input, conditional statements, and functions. It is a simple anime fact quiz with 5 questions.
